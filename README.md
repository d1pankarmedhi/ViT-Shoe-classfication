### 💡 Fine tuning

Pre-trained weights from the **[ViT-B_16](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.vit_b_16.html#vit-b-16)  model in `torchvision`** were leveraged to significantly improve model performance and training efficiency by fine-tuning the model on shoe dataset.
