# ViT-vision-transformer Shoe classification

ViT paper implementation in PyTorch for classification of shoe brands.

## Classification of Shoe brand using ViT ü™ô

There are total 3 brand shoe images in the dataset and the object is to classify them as `Adidas` , `Converse` or `Nike` based on the input image.

## Final result looks like this üßë‚Äçüç≥

## Model Summary üèãÔ∏è

A complete model summary of the Vision Transformer with around `86M` parameters. This implementation is based on the **ViT-Base** model.

Due to data and hardware limitations, the original implementation model did not perform well. To solve this issue, the VIT model weights from pytorch was used.

Fine tuned on [VIT_B_16](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.vit_b_16.html#vit-b-16) weights on the shoe dataset.

For blocks, embeddings scripts, check out the `vit` directory under the `blocks` directory. This has all the architecture code, including the patch embedding, multi head attention, multi layer perceptron and the transformer encoder block code.
